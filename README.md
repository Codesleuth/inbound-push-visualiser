inbound-push-visualiser
=======================

Listens to my deployed [esendex-push app](https://github.com/Codesleuth/esendex-push) for inbound messages and displays them kinda fancy.

Originally created for the Esendex office opening party in my spare time, but can be used by anyone for the same thing. However, I would recommend you host your own esendex-push instance for stability. See that project for details.
